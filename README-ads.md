# Google AdSense Integration & ads.txt Setup

## ads.txt File Configuration

Your YouTube Downloader Pro application is properly configured for Google AdSense monetization with an ads.txt file.

### Current Setup

✅ **ads.txt file created** at both:
- `/ads.txt` (root directory - for production)
- `/public/ads.txt` (public directory - for development)

✅ **Server route configured** to serve ads.txt with proper headers:
- Content-Type: `text/plain; charset=utf-8`
- Cache-Control: `public, max-age=86400` (24 hours)

### How it Works

**In Development Mode:**
- The Vite development server intercepts all routes
- The ads.txt file may not be directly accessible via browser
- This is normal behavior for development

**In Production Mode:**
- The ads.txt file will be properly served at `yoursite.com/ads.txt`
- Express server will handle the route with correct content type
- Google AdSense crawlers can access the file

### Setup Instructions

1. **Get your Google AdSense Publisher ID:**
   - Sign up for Google AdSense
   - Get approved for monetization
   - Copy your Publisher ID (format: `pub-1234567890123456`)

2. **Update the ads.txt file:**
   - Replace `pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Publisher ID
   - The file is located at `/ads.txt` in your project root

3. **Deploy your application:**
   - The ads.txt file will be automatically served in production
   - Verify accessibility at `yoursite.com/ads.txt`

4. **Submit to Google AdSense:**
   - Add your ads.txt URL in your AdSense account
   - Wait for Google to crawl and verify the file

### ads.txt File Format

```
google.com, pub-YOUR_PUBLISHER_ID, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

### Current Ad Placements

Your app includes placeholder ad spaces for:
- **Header Banner** (728x90)
- **Rectangle Ad** (300x250) 
- **Footer Banner** (728x90)

These will display Google AdSense ads once you:
1. Update the Publisher ID in ads.txt
2. Add the AdSense JavaScript code to your HTML
3. Get approval from Google AdSense

### Testing ads.txt in Production

Once deployed, test your ads.txt file:
```bash
curl https://yoursite.com/ads.txt
```

Should return:
```
google.com, pub-YOUR_PUBLISHER_ID, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

### Additional Networks

You can add more ad networks to the ads.txt file:
```
google.com, pub-YOUR_PUBLISHER_ID, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
amazon-adsystem.com, 3456, DIRECT
facebook.com, 123456789, DIRECT
```

Your YouTube downloader is fully prepared for AdSense monetization!
